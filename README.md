## Observations
* It was a great experience learning how to navigate through pages with chrome dev tools to find where to apply styles. I can definitely say my CSS3 styling skills have doubled during this project.  I also found Wordpress to be an amazing way to manage and develop a website. I feel like I got a good handle on it, but there is still much to learn.
